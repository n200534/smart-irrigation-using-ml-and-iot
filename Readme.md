                                                Smart Irrigation System using IoT and Machine Learning



                                                
Overview:
This project aims to create an intelligent irrigation system by combining Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. The system utilizes soil moisture and humidity sensors to collect data from the field, which is then transmitted to the cloud. Machine Learning algorithms process this data to determine the optimal amount of water required for irrigation. The NodeMCU microcontroller retrieves the calculated values from the cloud, compares them with real-time sensor data, and triggers irrigation if necessary.

Features
Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the moisture level in the soil.
Humidity Sensor: Collects ambient humidity data.
Cloud Integration: Data from sensors is sent to the cloud for processing.
Machine Learning: Calculates the required irrigation amount based on sensor data.
NodeMCU Control: Retrieves ML-calculated values and controls irrigation.
